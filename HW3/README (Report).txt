I did not attempt the extra credit portion of this assignment, so the output for my neural network is binary, with one output node.

For the activation function I used sigmoid.

This is a two layer neural network, with one hidden layer. It is designed to be flexible on how many hidden nodes there are, however through trial
and error I have found that 5 nodes has a good balance between time and accuracy.

It is also flexible on the number of epochs, however it seems to only need one epoch (again through trial and error)

Even with only one epoch the network gets roughly 100% accuracy on the test data.
